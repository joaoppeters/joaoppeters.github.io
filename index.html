    I am a PhD student in Electrical Engineering at EESC-USP and a Graduate Research and Teaching Assistant at the
    <a href="https://lacsep.github.io">LACSEP Laboratory</a>. My work focuses on the steady-state and transient analysis
    of electrical power system operations. My research interests include: power system stability and control; nonlinear
    systems analysis and control; power system planning and operation.
