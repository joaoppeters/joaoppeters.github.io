# About Constance
Since August 2022 I have been a doctoral researcher at EESC-USP. My interests lie in the steady-state and transient analysis of electrical power systems operation, with special emphasis on stability and security analysis, and mathematical modeling of electrical equipments in the power flow problem.

I received my graduate and masters degrees from the Federal University of Juiz de Fora (UFJF). My MSc proposed sigmoid-smooth modelings for SVCs and synchronous generators reactive power limits in the power flow problem, investigating the impacts of the smooth model regarding LIB and SNB bifurcation points. You can find my thesis [here](https://repositorio.ufjf.br/jspui/handle/ufjf/15471).


<h2>Personal</h2>
I grew up in Juiz de Fora, MG-Brazil! I enjoy sports and generally being outdoors.

<!-- Grand Teton National Park in early May. It turns out that this is far too early in the year to visit, scrambled up the rocks because the trail was packed with several feet of snow.  -->
