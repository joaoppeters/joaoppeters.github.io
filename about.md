# About me
Since August'23 I have been a PhD student and researcher in Electrical Engineering at EESC-USP, affiliated with the [LACSEP Laboratory](lacsep.github.io). My research focuses on the steady-state and transient analysis of electrical power system operations, with particular emphasis on power system stability and control, nonlinear systems analysis, security assessment, and the mathematical modeling of electrical equipment within the power flow problem.

I received my graduate and masters degrees from the Federal University of Juiz de Fora (UFJF). My MSc proposed sigmoid-smooth modelings for SVCs and synchronous generators reactive power limits in the power flow problem, investigating the impacts of the smooth model regarding LIB and SNB bifurcation points. You can find my thesis [here](https://repositorio.ufjf.br/jspui/handle/ufjf/15471).

<h2>Personal</h2>
I grew up in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais. I am a Christian, and my faith plays an important role in guiding my personal values and worldview. I enjoy sports and generally being outdoors.

> the way of a serpent on a rock,  
> the way of a ship on the high seas,  
> and the way of a man with a maiden.”
