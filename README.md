I am an Graduate Research Assistant at [LACSEP/EESC-USP](https://lacsep.github.io). My research consists on steady-state and transient analysis of electrical power systems operation, with special emphasis on stability and security analysis, and mathematical modeling of electrical equipments in the power flow problem.
