I am a PhD student in Electrical Engineering at EESC-USP and a Graduate Research and Teaching Assistant at the [LACSEP Laboratory](https://lacsep.github.io). My work focuses on the steady-state and transient analysis of electrical power system operations. My research interests include: Power system stability and control; Nonlinear systems analysis and control; Power system planning and operation; Stability and security assessment of power systems.
