I am a Graduate Research Assistant at [LACSEP/EESC-USP](https://lacsep.github.io), where I focus on the steady-state and transient analysis of electrical power system operations. My research emphasizes stability and security assessments, as well as the mathematical modeling of electrical equipment within power flow studies.
